Java Stdin and Stdout II:
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-stdin-stdout/problem?isFullScreen=true
When you call scan.nextInt() and scan.nextDouble(), the scanner reads the integer and double values. However, it doesn't consume the newline character (\n) generated when the user presses "Enter."
As a result, when scan.nextLine() is called, it reads this leftover newline character instead of waiting for the actual string input.
To fix this, you need to add an extra scan.nextLine() after reading the double to consume the leftover newline character. Here's the corrected code:

Java Output Formatting: 
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-output-formatting/problem?isFullScreen=true
%-15s%03d%n
%-15s: This formats a string (s) to be left-justified within 15 characters. If the string is shorter than 15 characters, it will be padded with spaces on the right.
%03d: This formats an integer (d) to be exactly 3 digits long, with leading zeros if necessary. For example, 5 would be formatted as 005.
%n: This inserts a platform-specific newline character.
